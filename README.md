# CS-330-Comp-Graphic-and-Visualization

Learning OpenGL and Computational Graphics certainly gave me a much more unique learning experience compared to any other class or topic I've tried learning before. Rather than give me a new perspective on how to approach software design, or give me a new skillset to incorporate, it reinforced my previously taught beliefs of properly envisioning how to tackle the entire project and possible issues to address before starting. However, I got to "envision" the finished product in a literal way, as I can already see what I need to do with the pictures taken being my guide. With that, I got to be able to take advantage of the neatly organized and reusable code based handed to me, which inspires me to focus on a more OOP related path when programming. Using the given code and modifying small parts and iterating until a proper finished object is created was certainly an enjoyable experience and allowed me to excel in the milestones and through the project's completion, and likely throughout the foreseeable future.
